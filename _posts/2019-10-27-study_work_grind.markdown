Working a day job and going home to code is a very difficult thing to handle. But not Impossible....... Where is the space that holds the memory to the object called possibility. The Possiblity lies in the vision held  in a  class constant which carries over to every instance of days in your journey.

Faith is the method that allows the feeling of confusion when  a concept or lab just doesn't make sense. Hope allows one to carry on to the euporia of  finding a solution to that problem.I put forth my time and effort and i will reach my goal of becoming a productive developer. I use the word productive because i am looking to be apart of  the development of great products and tools that help make the world and life much easier. I have hit roadblocks. I have stumbled and got back up for more. I feel stress in parts of my neck and head and have to walk around sometimes to relieve it. This is what someone has told me happens when your brain is working its magic. I believe in magic behind the scenes so that makes sense. The more i study hours upon hours the more i become heavily entrnched in the mind state of a programming. The constant iterating thoughts through my mind compells me to contnue to search for problems even when i am nowhere finding a solution.

 I will continue to punch away at the keyboard until i am speak the language of code like a french citizen speaking their native tongue.
